# DimRed - Dimension Reduction Package

This python package aims at offering Dimension Reduction capabilities leveraging algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and others.
The core of PCA is built on scikitlearn functionality.
Besides PCA, this package will be extended to offer additional capabilities such as SVD (TruncatedSVD) and SparsePCA.
Ultimately, this package will also offer some "auto-ml" like capabilities picking the best approach based on your data.

# Installation
You need to run Python 3.X.
And you should set up a virtual environment with `conda` or `virtualenv`
